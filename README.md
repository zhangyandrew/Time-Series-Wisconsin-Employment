**Contributer:**
- Andrew Zhang

This repo was created in order to display my findings working with Wisconsin employment data during my graduate level Time Series course. We were told to apply Box Jenkins Methods in order to find the most effective model for the data and forecast 5 years into the future based on the trend line.

The main techniques applied in this project were:
- **Box-Cox/Logarithmic/Square-Root Transformations**
- **Seasonal Differencing(ACF/PACF)**
- **ARMA Model Fitting**
- **Box-Pierce Tests/L-Jung Tests**
- **Forecasting**
- **Spectral Analysis**

The project is also detailed in the same order as listed above.
